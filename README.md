## FYI

1. #### Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '?'

   Create a ` .php-version ` file and simply type in your php version to fix the error

   Example : ` 8.1.3 `

2. #### Database

   Change the database path in the ` .env ` file, and don't forget to add the ` .env ` file to your .gitignore

3. #### Aliases

   ` @ ` refers to ` /{DIRECTORY}/assets ` path
   
   Can be changed or added in the webpack file using `.addAliases()`
   
   Example : 
   ```
   .addAliases({
        '@': `${__dirname}/assets`,
    })
    ```
